# ArgoCD Helm Deployment

This repository contains the Helm chart for deploying an application with ArgoCD. It includes Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application, setting up services, and managing ingress.

## Repository Structure

```bash
.
├── templates
│   ├── _helpers.tpl        # Template helper file for common functions in Helm
│   ├── deployment.yaml     # Defines the deployment of the application
│   ├── ingress.yaml        # Manages ingress resources for external access
│   ├── service.yaml        # Defines services for accessing the application
├── Chart.yaml              # The main Helm chart file
├── README.md               # Documentation (this file)
├── values.yaml             # Values file for customizing the Helm chart
```

### File Breakdown

- **`_helpers.tpl`**: Contains helper templates for simplifying repeated configurations across the Helm chart.
- **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes deployment for the application, specifying pod configurations, container images, replicas, and other deployment parameters.
- **`ingress.yaml`**: Configures ingress rules for routing external traffic to the application. This typically includes setting up domain names, TLS certificates, and routing paths.
- **`service.yaml`**: Defines Kubernetes services to expose the application internally or externally (depending on service type) within the cluster.
- **`Chart.yaml`**: The Helm chart metadata file, which includes information such as the chart name, version, and any dependencies.
- **`values.yaml`**: The default configuration values for the Helm chart. These values can be overridden by users during deployment to customize the application’s behavior.

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure that you have a working Kubernetes cluster.
- **ArgoCD**: This repository assumes you are using ArgoCD for managing the continuous deployment of the application.
- **Helm**: Helm must be installed in your environment to package and deploy the chart.
